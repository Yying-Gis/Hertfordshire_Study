## Historic Map Geo-referencing: Swingate Boundary and Maintenance Comparison

Historic map geo-referencing and boundary/maintenance comparison for Swingate (Hertfordshire).  
Case study project for learning GIS and spatial analysis.  

⚠️ **Disclaimer**: This project is for study and practice only.

## 📌 Overview
This project compares the **1973 Ordnance Survey historic map of Swingate** with the current alignment (OpenStreetMap).  
It also looks at changes in road boundaries and how they relate to maintenance responsibility.

## 🛠️ Method
- Historic map (1973 OS) was geo-referenced to OpenStreetMap in ArcGIS Pro.  
- The modern Swingate boundary was digitised from OSM.  
- Overlay analysis highlights small changes (road widening, roundabout, etc.).  

---

## 🔎 Key Findings
- Swingate alignment is **mostly unchanged**, with minor modifications.  
- Historic map geo-referencing can support boundary and highway law discussions.  
- Case study demonstrates GIS use in **UK historic mapping** and **local planning**.
